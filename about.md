Hello! Here's the TL;DR about me:
- CS-Math @ Harvey Mudd College '26 
- Described as a great leader who picks up on new tasks at hand quickly by past coaches/employers 
- A great teacher, able to articulate complex concepts to those with any level of understanding
  - Have years of experience tutoring/mentoring (youth orchestra, high school, and college)
  - Exactly what you need in any helpful team member :)

### More Information

My interests go beyond CS and Math:

- I love working with arts and crafts, take a look <a href="https://shreyareddi.github.io/Personal-Projects/"> here </a>!
- Interested in Economics/Venture Capital and using computing to improve the systems used today
- My idea of unwinding involves rewatching sitcoms (Modern Family!), visiting the beach, and spending time with loved ones
