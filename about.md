Hello! Here's the TL;DR about me:
- CS-Math '26 @ Harvey Mudd College
- described as a great leader with the drive to get things done by past coaches 
- I'm a great teacher, qualified to teach complex concepts to anyone!
  - Exactly what you need in a PM or any helpful team member

### More Information

My interests go beyond CS and Math:

- Small business owner <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shopmikamina"> @shopmikamina </a>
- I love working with arts and crafts, refining my eye for small details!
- I'm interested in Economics and understanding why and how people make decisions
  - This allows me to understand the choices team members or partners may make and provide me with the resources to guide them with their decisions
